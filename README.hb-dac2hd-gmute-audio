Name:   hb-dac2hd-gmute-audio
Info:   Configures the ALTernative driver for the HifiBerry DAC2 HD audio card.
        This overlay controls an external mute relay via gpio. By default, it
	uses gpio 23 (pin 16) but this can be changed using the optional
	mute_gpio param.
         eg. "dtoverlay=hb-dac2hd-gmute-audio,mute_gpio=23"
        The mute gpio is configured active_low and the relay should shunt the
	analogue outputs to ground when the gpio output is (0V) low. After the
	PLL clock is configured and the DAC has been reset, the mute gpio will
	be set high (3.3V), which should cause the relay to remove the shunt to
        ground. This is the default behaviour. The optional auto_gpio_mute
	causes gpio relay muting to be applied dynamicaly by the driver when
        the audio stream is opened/closed.
         eg. "dtoverlay=hb-dac2hd-gmute-audio,agm"
        card 0: DAC2HD [HiFiBerry DAC2HD], device 0: HiFiBerry DAC2 HD HiFi
         pcm1796-hifi-0 [HiFiBerry DAC2 HD HiFi pcm1796-hifi-0]
        NB. [hw:CARD=DAC2HD]. (Original driver [hw:CARD=sndrpihifiberry])
Load:   dtoverlay=hb-dac2hd-gmute-audio,<param>=<val>
Params: mute_gpio               GPIO for MUTE (default 23 (PIN 16))
        agm                     Automatically use gpio_mute. Default is to
                                unmute once at startup after PCM1796 reset.
